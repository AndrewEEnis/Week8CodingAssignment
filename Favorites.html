    <h2>Favorite Ways to Spend a Day:</h2>
    <p>While there are many ways to spend the day in Seattle, here are a few of my favorites!</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Getting Around the City</h3>
      <p>
        Just like most metropolitan areas in the country, there are many
        different transportation options. Driving is a common choice for
        residents and visitors, but the most convenient option is the Sound
        Transit Link Light Rail. Many residents or visitors park near stations
        and travel throughout the city with this method.

      <h3>Culture</h3>
      <h4>Theatre</h4>
      <p>
        <img src="https://uploads.visitseattle.org/2015/03/5thAveTheatreInterior-768x591.jpg"width="500"alt="Paramount"/><br />
        Seattle’s lively theatre scene is second to none. You can catch a bold
        new premiere or an inventive interpretation of the classics at Seattle
        Repertory Theatre, ACT or Book-It. Be dazzled by a blockbuster Broadway
        show at the historic Paramount or 5th Avenue Theatre. Or dive in to
        Seattle’s longest running improv theatre at Unexpected Productions.
      </p>
      <h4>Dance</h4>
      <p>

        <br />
        Pacific Northwest Ballet is widely recognized as one of the country’s
        premiere regional dance companies. Founded in 1972, it is now delighting
        audiences under the artistic leadership of Peter Boal, a well-regarded
        former dancer with a distinguished 22 year career with the New York City
        Ballet. The sheer brilliance of the choreographers and dancers will captivate you. Under the leadership of Artistic Director and Tony-nominated choreographer Donald Byrd, Spectrum Dance Theatre produces acclaimed and ambitious works in contemporary dance. If you want to put on your own dancing shoes, don’t miss the Century Ballroom. With its elegantly draped balconies and glossy wood floors, it sets the mood to swing or salsa, and for those of us with two left feet, lessons are usually offered before the dance. You can usually find top international and national companies performing at The Paramount Theatre, On the Boards or the Meany Center for the Performing Arts, or catch our up-and-coming artists at Cornish College of the Arts.

      <h4>Live Music</h4>

        With so many venues that cater to every taste, Seattle is a true mecca for live music. Here’s a small sampling of our most epic places to see your favorite bands:

          <li>The Crocodile – Named by Rolling Stone Magazine as one of “The Best Clubs in America,” there may be no other spot in the Pacific Northwest with such storied and beloved past, and no other rock and roll venue that has earned its right to occupy the hearts of so many. Countless incredible bands played within their walls, so come check out who’s up next.</li><br />
          <li>The Showbox – With two locations (across from Pike Place Market and in SoDo), the Showbox has Seattle covered.
